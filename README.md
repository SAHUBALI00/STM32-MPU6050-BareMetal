# STM32-MPU6050-BareMetal
This project is a deep-dive into embedded systems architecture. I developed a fully functional I2C communication driver for the STM32F103 (Cortex-M3) from the ground up, bypassing high-level libraries (HAL/LL). By manipulating memory-mapped registers, I achieved real-time data acquisition from an MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope.
